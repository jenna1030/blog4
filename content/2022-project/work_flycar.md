> 2D Car Interior Rendering

This project showcases a 2D rendering of the Mitsubishi Outlander interior, meticulously crafted in Photoshop. The concept brings creativity to life by visualizing the car as if it were soaring through the sky, blending realism with imagination.

The detailed dashboard, seats, and natural lighting create a smooth, futuristic experience that transcends conventional car design.
